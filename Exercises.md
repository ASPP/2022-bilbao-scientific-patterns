Exercises:


1. Turn functions into class. Write a grid search.
-> learning: how to write a class

2. Write read parameters from json file
-> learning: how to make reproducible experiments

3. 
    a) Give snippets for how the activation is generated - give them code to visualize for fun. they write the functions for initialization within the class. The initialize function then takes a string and uses if/else
        -> discuss whether this generalizes well
   b) break out initializer of the field into a new class.
        -> learning:  breaking out varying stuff

4. write code to pass in estimation algorithm ( grid search)  run estimation of best fitting parameters given some precomputed data. Give w different estimation algorithm.
-> learning:  breaking out varying stuff, but with less guidance

5. simulate a trajectory. Save alongside the initialization json. run notebook that loads the data and makes some plots.  (can another team reproduce the same plots?)
-> structure of experiments
