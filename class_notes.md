# Before the start

- Ask: who has written a class before? should be paired with someone who has not

# Introduction


End of intro
- We’ll show some code, and put it together and break it apart several times to illustrate how to make it practical to use, but flexible 
Then we’ll discuss how to do a similar thing at a research project level

# Chapter 1, classes

Before starting with the notebook
- We’ll start by looking at putting things together that belong together
- Kwy question: How do we know what does?

- We know data structures that groups data together, lists, dictionaries, etc; and modules and packages that organize code with a similar scope
- Here we’ll look at functions and classes as a way to group data and functionality together in a way that is easy to use but remain flexible to changes




Walker saga

- intro

# smells
# current_i, current_j, sigma_i, sigma_j needed all over the place
# not efficient: mgrid calculated every time
# defining the parameters of a run is tedious: define all the single variables
# need to do the bookkeeping for i, j in case you want to create / simulate entire trajectories
# changing the next step probability is going to be trouble
# adding a new activation map requires adding a new piece to the code
# what if map_type is not any of the 3?

- create a class (exercise)

# all parameters are specified once at the start, grouped together nicely
# the signature of most functions is simplified
# ???
# should compute_selection_map be private
# in general, which methods should be private?
# should i, j belong to the class
# should random_state belong to the class

# smells that remain
# need to do the bookkeeping for i, j in case you want to create / simulate entire trajectories
# changing the next step probability is going to be trouble
# adding a new activation map requires adding a new piece to the code
# what if map_type is not any of the 3?

- add a factory method for the context map

# the activation map initialization varies independently from the class
# we can now add a new activation map initialization without changing the code -> more
# flexibility, extendability
# ???

# smells that remain
# need to do the bookkeeping for i, j in case you want to create / simulate entire trajectories
# changing the next step probability is going to be trouble

- serialization
# Open discussion: what happens when the class changes?
# Discussion in to_json: what happens if the code breaks before the array is saved? What to do about it?


- break out the context map initialization

# the activation map initialization varies independently from the class
# we can now add a new activation map initialization without changing the code -> more
# flexibility, extendability
# ???
# the example is a bit artificial

# smells that remain
# need to do the bookkeeping for i, j in case you want to create / simulate entire trajectories
# changing the next step probability is going to be trouble

- break out the next step probability (exercise)

# ... let's say we want to have a rectangular, uniform next step distribution

# talk about the fact that we can pass anything as long as you can call it as initializer(size)


# The Walker class has less parameters!
# its responsibilities are clearer
# now serialization is going to be harder

# smells that remain
# need to do the bookkeeping for i, j in case you want to create / simulate entire trajectories

    size = activation_map.shape[0]
    next_step_map = next_step_probability(current_i, current_j, sigma_i, sigma_j, size)
    selection_map = compute_selection_map(next_step_map, activation_map)
    return selection_map[current_i, current_j]
